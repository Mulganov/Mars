The Mars Rover Test

Our story: 

We all are NASA employees, I'm an engineer, and you are a software engineer. NASA is going to send an explorer rover to Mars next month. The rover can make 4 movements:
•	Straight ahead one step
•	To the right. First turn to the right and make one step forward
•	To the left. First turn to the left and make one step forward
•	Back one step (without turning)

We mounted a fixed camera on the rover so that it can show only straight ahead — the camera can’t turn on its own.

So I need an algorithm which can answer these two questions:
1)	I need to know where the explorer rover is located;
2)	I need to know which direction the camera is facing.

As sending the rover and camera to Mars is expensive we need to be sure that your software is working right, so you need to test this, which is the 3rd task.

Here are some guidelines how it should be done:

1)	The rover management program should be written in a single class, doesn`t matter which programming language you use, may also be in plain English;
2)	The test should be done in a separate class with methods which return true or false;
3)	You can use paper or an editor on a computer, you don’t have to care about syntax this time.
